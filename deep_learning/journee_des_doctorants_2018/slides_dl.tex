  \textcolor{blue}{Deep learning} is a subfield of machine learning in
  which we use \textcolor{blue}{artificial neural networks} to make

  An artificial neural networks is a computation model \emph{loosely}
  based on the human brain. It aims to mimic electric signals
  travelling through neurons in order to make computations.
