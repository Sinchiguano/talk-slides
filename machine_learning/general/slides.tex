  \frametitle{Goal of machine learning}


  The idea of machine learning is to \textcolor{red}{predict}
  something from \textcolor{blue}{data} and
  \textcolor{brown}{experience}.

  \bigskip

  A good example of machine learning usecase is meteo prediction:

  \textcolor{brown}{Experience}: Paris usually have the same weather
  as London a day after.\\
  \textcolor{blue}{Data}: It is raining in London today.\\
  \textcolor{red}{Prediction}: It will probably rain in Paris tomorrow.

  \bigskip

  Machine learning algorithms are \textcolor{cyan}{strategies} used by
  computer programs to complete this kind of tasks.
