  \frametitle{Machine learning}

  Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence.

  \bigskip

  \begin{description}
    \item[Intuitively] We want to \emph{learn from} and \emph{make predictions
    on} data.

      \medskip

    \item[Technically] We want to update the parameters of a model to
      make it describe our training data as well as possible (``well''
      being defined by a \emph{loss function}).
