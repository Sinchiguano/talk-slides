  \begin{align*}
    c &= ai + b\\
    i^{2} &= -1
  \end{align*}

  The \emph{norm} of a complex number is its euclidiean distance to 0:

  \begin{align*}
    c &= ai + b \\
    |c| &= \sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}} \\
  \end{align*}

  \begin{verbatim}
In [1]: c = complex(1, 2)

In [2]: c
Out[2]: (1+2j)

In [3]: c + complex(0,3)
Out[3]: (1+5j)

In [4]: c * c
Out[4]: (-3+4j)
  \end{verbatim}

  \framesubtitle{Function to iterate}

  The formula that generates everything is the following one:

  \begin{align*}
    z_{0} &= c \\
    z_{n + 1} &= z_{n}^{2} + c
  \end{align*}

  For each pixel $(x, y)$ of the screen, we compute the corresponding
  complex number $c_{x,y}$.

  \bigskip

  Now we compute a fixed number of terms of the sequence above
  starting with $z_{0} = c_{x,y}$.

  \begin{align*}
    z_{0} &= c_{x, y} \\
    z_{1} &= c_{x, y}^{2} + c_{x, y} \\
    z_{2} &= z_{1}^{2} + c_{x, y} = (c_{x, y}^{2} + c_{x, y})^{2} + c_{x, y} \\
    \dots \\
    z_{100} &= z_{99}^{2} + c_{x, y}
  \end{align*}
